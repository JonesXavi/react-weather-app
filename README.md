# React Weather App [DEMO](https://jbx-react-weather-today.netlify.app/)


A simple weather app built using React 17 utilizing a public weather API [Meta Weather](https://www.metaweather.com/).

## How it works

On the initial load, the app loads the weather by fetching the user location based on Latitude & Longitude (from browser permission). Also, user can check weather of any city through search form. 


### Features

- User Location based weather 
- 5 days weather forecast
- Light / Dark Mode Toggle


Faced Cors Issue while fetching from the Meta Weather API, fixed it by hosting a private [CORS](https://jbx-cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) server.
